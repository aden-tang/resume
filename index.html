        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have a little experience when it comes to accounting, but I possess skills that makes me a great asset for any work I do. Growing up, I worked as a waiter and with that
        I have a lot of experience when dealing with customers and living up to work standards. Not only do I know how to work with customers, I also know ways to read my surroundings. I learned 
        a lot about people as I worked and obtained the ability to see how people feel. I never thought of this ability as something that would be useful, but with its daily uses, I see how beneficial
        it is to me. I am also a team player, but know when to take a stand for myself. When working together with everyone else, I will listen to what they have to say and think about my own
        ideas and that helps me come up with new ideas.<br><br>

        I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I like to communicate about their problems and help them works towards bettering or solving their problems. I can't leave people to deal with
        things that they aren't able to deal with on their own. I can't help myself and always tries to help those that are in need of help, but are too scared to ask for help. Anything that is
        usually related to another living organism, I am good at. Growing up, I have always beem poor and have not gotten the opportunity to do something that I really love doing which is travelling.
        I aspire to be someone of great wealth in order to do what I love to do and live in a world where I don't have to care about money. My biggest dream is to have a loving and caring family
        that I can take care of until the day I die.<br><br>

        Outside activities I do to improve myself are going to gym and I also like to do sports. I enjoy anything that is exciting. During my middle school and high school years, I did a lot of competitive
        handball. I was really good at it and with each opponents I go through, I learn about new things. One thing that was really hard on me was that the world is unfair and not everyone can have 
        the same things. It was enjoyable but it was also painful to think about how others felt, but I know that what I want is also important to me, so I would do anything to get what I want rather than
        letting someone else have it just because they also worked hard for it. I also realized that trophies are just medals to display that a person has done something significant, but it doesn't 
        really evaluate someones true worth. I have a lot of trophies, but they are all meaningless to me now as soon as I look at life differently and see that my self worth is what I should know about
        rather than have something materialistic to prove it. ALthough I do think having all the material things is a privelege that many people shouldn't have unless they worked for.
